### To-do

- Write about unification
- Fix link at the last paragraph of ["Embedding a logic programming language in Haskell"][6]
- Proofread "Unification in 75 lines of Haskell"
- Proofread "Eliminating data types"

### Ideas

- `Applicative -> Monad`: write about monads which can by implemented in terms of `(<*>)` and `pure` (like the [arrow monad][1]; see also: [representable functors][2])

### Low priority
- [An unsolvable problem of elementary number theory][3]
- [Deriving the Y combinator][4]
- [A timeline for logic, Î»-calculus, and programming language theory][5]
