This directory should contain work in progress blog posts. Completed posts should be moved to `.done`. Every post should be proofread.

### Todo

- Write more stuff!
- Make already visited links a different color

### Ideas

**Representable functors**

Write about monads which can by implemented in terms of `(<*>)` and `pure` ([representable functors][2]). This may be related with SKI combinator calculus and the reader monad (`((->) r)` is a `MonadReader r` with `ask = id`). How to describe `Applicative`, SKI combinator calculus, and `MonadReader` in categorical terms?

Interesting resources:
- [Applicative programming with effects][11] section 7
- [Applicative Functors][12]

### Low priority
- [An unsolvable problem of elementary number theory][3]
- [Deriving the Y combinator][4]
- [A timeline for logic, Î»-calculus, and programming language theory][5]
