# Topology in Lean

The biggest difference between the usual approach to topology and the one here is the change if foundations. We will use Lean to formalize things as we go. Lean's foundations is dependent type theory which, for our purposes, differs in slight but significantly from the usual set theoretic approach.

### Set Theory versus Type Theory

The biggest difference between set theory and type theory is what comes first. In set theory, elements come first and are then collected into sets. In type theory, types come first and every term has a unique type.

\[
  A : \operatorname{Type}
\]

$$A : \operatorname{Type}$$
