# The simplest programming language

It has been just over an year since I've started using Haskell. The most amazing experience I had with the language was to discover _how little_ it actually is. Languages like C are very small, but you still have a bunch of primitives: integers, pointer, loops, and conditional statements. Other languages have a bunch of fancy features, many which end up adding a bunch of primitives. But, in the first few months of learning Haskell, I was constantly surprised with what was _not_ built in.

The best example of this is the `($)` operator. Everyone encounters `($)` soon after starting with Haskell. It provides a really nice way of eliminating some parenthesis and make code easier to read. It is functionally "useless:" it is syntactic sugar! And yet, it is not primitive!

```
($) :: (a -> b) -> a -> b
f $ x = f x

infixr 0 $
```

That is quite surprising!

Naturally, types such booleans and lists can also be defined within the language:

```
data Bool
  = True
  | False

data List a
  = Cons a (List a)
  | Nil
```

It might even be tempting to define lists as:

```
data [a] = [] | a : [a]
```

While it is not valid Haskell, [it is exactly how the Haskell language report describes lists!][1]

Haskell basically is functions and algebraic data types, with type classes thrown in the mix to make life easier.

However, not all features are made equal: ones can be implemented in terms of others. This post is here to show that algebraic data types, one of the crowning jewels of Haskell, could be entirely replaced with its real best feature: lambda abstractions. In fact, we could program everything _only_ with lambdas. Sounds impossible, but it is actually doable.

### Turing machines

Well, it might not be that surprising that lambdas can do everything, after all, Turing machines also can! Turing machines are just state machines with an infinite tapes!

Turing machines model what is considered _computable_.
